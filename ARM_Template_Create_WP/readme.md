### üîç Overview of template files
The main ARM template (`azuredeploy.json`) is highly configurable and well-documented. You can deploy it without making any changes, but it will prompt you for parameters. You can pre-populate these parameters using the included parameters file (`azuredeploy.parameters.json`).

## üöÄ How to Deploy
1. Modify the parameters file (`azuredeploy.parameters.json`) with the input values for your environment. It's recommended to have a parameters file per environment/deployment.
2. Replace the `null` values in the file with the appropriate settings for your configuration as few sensitive parameters as secure strings and those are set to `null`.
3. Modify the deployment scripts (`deploy.azcli` and `deploy.ps1`) and update the input parameters, such as the resource group name and location, to match your deployment needs.
4. Run the deployment scripts:
    - For Bash script: `./deploy.azcli`
    - For PowerShell script: `./deploy.ps1`
