# Wordpress on Windows App Service

Support for PHP on Windows App Service ends with PHP 7.4 (see [PHP Support on App Service](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/php_support.md))

Aligned with PHP 7.4 end of life (EOL) we will stop supporting the option of creating **Wordpress apps on Windows instances of App Service** through our [Azure Gallery template](https://aka.ms/linux-wordpress).

Existing apps should not be affected and will continue to run, however we do encourage you to [consider migrating to linux](../WordPress/wordpress_migration_linux_appservices.md).
