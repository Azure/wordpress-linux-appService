# üñ•Ô∏è WordPress on Windows App Service

Support for PHP on Windows App Service has ended with PHP 7.4. For more information, see [PHP Support on App Service](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-linux-docs/blob/master/Runtime_Support/php_support.md).

With the end of life (EOL) for PHP 7.4, we no longer support creating **WordPress apps on Windows instances of App Service** through the [Azure Gallery template](https://aka.ms/linux-wordpress).

‚ö†Ô∏è Existing apps will continue to run, but we highly recommend [migrating to Linux](../WordPress/wordpress_migration_linux_appservices.md) for better long-term support and performance.
