# Adding PHP extensions for WordPress Linux App Services

Customers who need to install PHP extensions that are not available on the WordPress Linux App Services image can do so by following the below steps. Here we will take an example and show how to add soap extension for PHP version 8, and please note that the process would be similar for other extensions.


## Installing PHP Extensions

1. Go to your KUDU site using the following URL **https://\<sitename\>.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui** and select WebSSH.

2. Find out the PHP version of your WordPress image using the below command. 
``` 
php -v
```
3.	In your SSH console, run the below commands to install soap extension for PHP. Please note that depending on the version of the PHP, the name of the package needs to be updated accordingly. 
```
apk update
apk add php8-soap
```
Additionally, you can use the [Alpine Linux Packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) dashboard to search for your required PHP extensions. Note that you can make use of wildcards (* and ?) in the search and find the package.

4.	For PHP 8, the extensions will be installed under **/usr/lib/php8/modules/**. If you are not able to find it, you can make use of find command to locate the extension file. 
```
cd /
find . -name 'soap.so'
```

5.	Now that the extension is installed, you need to create an **ext** directory under **/home/site/** path and copy the extension file to it. This is because changes made outside /home path are non-persistent and will be reset to default state when the container is restarted. Below are the commands to do this.

```
mkdir -p /home/site/ext
cp /usr/lib/php8/modules/soap.so /home/site/ext/soap.so
```

6.	Then we need to create a **extensions.ini** file under **/home/site/ini** directory and add the configuration to it. You can use the below commands to do so.

```
mkdir -p /home/site/ini
echo 'extension=/home/site/ext/soap.so' >> /home/site/ini/extensions.ini
```

7. Go to your App Service in Azure Portal and add the following **Application Settings**. You will find Application Settings under **Settings -> Configurations** blade. Once the below settings are added, click on save. This will restart your Web App and new changes should be reflected.

|Application Settings Name  | Value                                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------
|PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR           |/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini    |



## Testing:
1.	To test if the extension is enabled or not, you can create a **phpinfo.php** file under **/home/site/wwwroot/** directory and add the code **<?php phpinfo();** to it. You can make use of the below command to do so. 
```
echo "<?php phpinfo();" > /home/site/wwwroot/phpinfo.php
```

2.	You should now see the extension is enabled by going to **https://\<sitename\>.azurewebsites.net/phpinfo.php**

3.	Remove the phpinfo.php page once youâ€™re done using the page.
```
rm /home/site/wwwroot/phpinfo.php
```
