<br>

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that offers efficient compression and high-quality visuals for web content. It employs both lossless and lossy compression techniques to reduce image file sizes significantly, making web pages load faster and consume less bandwidth. WebP supports both static and animated images and is widely supported by modern web browsers, making it a popular choice for web developers looking to optimize website performance while maintaining excellent image quality. Its versatility, compression capabilities, and broad compatibility have cemented WebP's role as a valuable tool in the world of web design and online content delivery.

## How to enable it?
WebP support has been enabled by default within the WordPress image as of **September 9th, 2023**. If your App Service was created prior to this date, you may need to restart it for the new changes to take effect.
